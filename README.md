# trailprofiler

GPS trails are fun to plot on a map, but then what? If they are from different places, it is difficult to compare them on the same map.

But **Trailprofiler** lets you compare your journeys side-by-side on the same chart. With the elevation profile perspective, you can quantify your pace and your climbs so that you know how much harder your last hike/run/bike really was.

And when you import your photos, it will associate them with the proper GPS trail and display them together.

Basically, **Trailprofiler** is an app to throw your GPX and JPG files into. And within this sandbox, you can correct the timestamps on photos and GPS trails in case your (old-school) device was off by a timezone or Daylight Savings Time. And the tool will also detect and plot dissimilar chunks of GPS data separately, in case your (old-school) device logged multiple sessions to the same file.
