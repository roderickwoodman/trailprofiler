## Trailprofiler Overview

GPS trails are fun to plot on a map, but once you start collecting several of them from different places, it gets difficult to compare them on the same map.

But **Trailprofiler** lets you compare your journeys side-by-side on the same chart. Using elevation profiles, you can visually quantify your climbs so that you know how much harder your last hike/run/bike really was.

## Additional Features

In addition to GPX file imports, this app also accepts image file imports, displaying both types together as the same session.

**Trailprofiler** also lets you correct for simple old-school device errors. It lets you shift the timestamps on photos and GPS trails in case your device was off by a timezone or Daylight Savings Time. And it will also detect separate dissimilar chunks of GPS data in case your device logged multiple sessions to the same GPX file.
