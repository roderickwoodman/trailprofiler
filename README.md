# trailprofiler

Many websites will plot your GPS data from your hike/run/bike on a map. This is can be a great visual. But really, map plots are only good at showing you where you went on that day. Tomorrow's outing may be somewhere completely different, and it may not even fit on that same map.

But **Trailprofiler** lets you compare your journeys to one another by plotting them side-by-side on the same chart. It shows you your data from an elevation profile perspective so that you can quantify with distances and climbs how much harder your last hike/run/bike really was.

In addition, in case there was an error in recording and your device recorded multiple sessions in one file, **Trailprofiler** will detect these dissimilar sections of data and will automatically plot these chunks separately, alongside the full data series of the file.
