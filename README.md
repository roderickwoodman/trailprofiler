# trailprofiler
These days, so many of the devices that we have can record where we've gone. And seeing those tracks on a map is certainly nice. But what then? The next track will likely be on a different map. And so will the next one.

But **Trailprofiler** lets you compare your journeys side-by-side in the only way that you can, with elevation profiles. It lets you manipulate your GPX data files with an easy Web interface. So you can quantify with quick visuals how much harder your last hike/run/bike really was.
